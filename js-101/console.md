# JS 101

## In the console ~10 mins

### Task 1

1. make a variable that is a number

```js
let myNumber = 5;
```

2. read the value of that variable

```
myNumber
> 5
```

3. reassign that variable to be itself plus 50

```js
myNumber = myNumber + 50;
```

or the shorthand for this common pattern...

```js
// this is called the addition assignment operator
myNumber += 50;
```

4. read the value of the variable to prove that it has changed

```
myNumber
> 55
```

5. repeat steps three and four but use [different mathematical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

## Task 2

1. Make a variable that is a string (`""` or `''`) eg

```js
let myString = "my favorite color is...";
```

2. Using the `+` operator, reassign your variable to be what it was before concatenated with another string

```js
myString = myString + " Blue!";
```

_\*shorthand works here too!_

3. Read the value of `myString` to prove to yourself that it has changed.

## Task 3

Visit [this list of operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp) and play around in the console using all the different operators. Think of yourself as an mad scientist in a lab playing with crazy chemicals that might blow up. The only way to find out what happens is to give it a go!

Make some variables that are numbers, strings and booleans. Have a go at building on what you've done before. Mash them together, tear them apart. Add a string to a number, minus a number from a boolean - go mad! If anything weird happens (and it will!) make a note of what it was and why you think its happening, we can then explain it or add it to our quirk bank and the mysteries will be revealed in time!
